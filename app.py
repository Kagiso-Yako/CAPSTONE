#AI researchers are based at South Africaâ€™s
#26 public universities and other research-based organisations. They publish the results of their research in
#a variety of venues, including journals, conference proceedings and workshop proceedings. The
#application will draw from and consolidate data from multiple public research data sources, including the
#researcher rating system used by the National Research Foundation (NRF) and Microsoft Academic
#Graph (MAG). A web based interface must be provided for users to perform queries and visualise
#information about the research community including: a) dominant research areas/topics, publications
#venues, collaborations (co-authors) and impact (citations) (b) t++in which
#researchers are based (c) finding interesting trends and patterns over time, (c) appropriate metrics to
#assess and analyse the community and network structure, and (d) manual update and synchronisation
#functionality with MAG, the NRF and other public data sources.
