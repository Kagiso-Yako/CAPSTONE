## Project Features

- **Python (Flask):** The project is primarily built using Flask, providing a robust and scalable web framework for our application.

- **AJAX and JSON:** These technologies enable dynamic and asynchronous communication with the server, enhancing the user experience and page responsiveness.

- **API Integration:** We've incorporated APIs to collect data from sources such as the National Research Foundation (NRF) and Google Scholar.

- **SQL Database:** We've established a backend SQL database to store and analyze the data obtained through APIs.

## Project Scope

Our primary focus was on data analysis within the South African AI research community. This involved:

- Identifying trends and patterns within the AI community.
- Providing users with accessible information about publications, collaborations, researcher details, and their locations.
